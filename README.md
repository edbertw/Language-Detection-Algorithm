# Language Detection with Naive-Bayes Algorithm
## Overview
In this short repository, I implemented a Language Multiclassification and detection algorithm uing Multinomial Naive Bayes. This model is trained on 2 different datasets which encompasses 30 distinct popular languages worldwide.
## Dataset
```dataset.csv``` and ```Language Detection.csv``` are two different datasets which both consist of a Text and Language column.
## Results
1. Multinomial NB Model Score: ```94.56 %```
2. Example Run:
```
Enter text to detect:  Apa namamu?
Text is Indonesian
```
