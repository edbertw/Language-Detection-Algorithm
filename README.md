# Language Detection with Naive-Bayes & Support Vector Algorithm
## Overview
In this short repository, I implemented a Language Multiclassification and detection algorithm uing Multinomial Naive Bayes and OvO Support Vector Machines. This model is trained on 2 different datasets which encompasses 30 distinct popular languages worldwide.
## Dataset
```dataset.csv``` and ```Language Detection.csv``` are two different datasets which both consist of a Text and Language column.
## Results
1. Multinomial NB Model Score: ```94.57 %```
2. OvO (One vs. One) SVM Model Score: ```84.48 %``` 
3. Example Run:
